# Week 1 Exercise 2
# Exercise 5: Two students take an exam, and their results are assigned to
# two variables: mark1 = 44; mark2=51;
# Write a program which calculates and displays average mark as float

mark1 = 44
mark2 = 51

# No need to convert this time as the variables will already be ints
average = (mark1 + mark2)/2
print("The Average is: " + str(average))
